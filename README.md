Repository to add my java projects 
I have created this repo to store all my codes for JAVA,
For now there is 1 branch in this repo, in the near future I will create a new sub branch for doing all experiments related to VCS, 
This Codes are related to my learning from various resources available from the internet,
The resources are mainly from Youtube and UDEMY;
But I do it just to be in touch with Git & GitHub and to know more about VCS/SCM/RCS. 
*WELL THIS IS IT FOR THIS REPO*
